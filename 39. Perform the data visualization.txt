39. Perform the data visualization operations using tableau.  (iris\_data\_sample)
    a.	Scatter Plot of SepalLength by SepalWidth
    b.	Show species wise distribution
    c.	Visualize correlation of PetalLength and PetalWidth

ðŸ”¹ a. Scatter Plot of SepalLength by SepalWidth
Open a new worksheet.

Drag SepalLengthCm to Columns.

Drag SepalWidthCm to Rows.

Drag Species to Color (under Marks card).

From the Marks type, ensure it's set to Scatter Plot (Circle).

Rename the sheet to Sepal Scatter.

ðŸ”¹ b. Show Species-wise Distribution
Option 1: Bar Chart (Count of Species)
Create a new worksheet.

Drag Species to Columns.

Drag Species again to Rows â€” Tableau will count the number of entries for each species.

Optional: Drag Species to Color to distinguish them.

Rename this sheet to Species Distribution.

ðŸ”¹ c. Visualize Correlation of PetalLength and PetalWidth
Open another worksheet.

Drag PetalLengthCm to Columns.

Drag PetalWidthCm to Rows.

Drag Species to Color to view correlation across different species.

Set Marks type to Circle.

You should see a clustered or linear pattern, indicating correlation.

Rename the sheet to Petal Correlation.

âœ… Optional: Create a Dashboard
Click on Dashboard â†’ New Dashboard.

Drag and drop all 3 sheets:

Sepal Scatter

Species Distribution

Petal Correlation

Add filters or interactivity if needed.
