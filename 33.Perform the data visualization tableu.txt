33.	Perform the data visualization operations using tableau. [Iris.csv]
a.	Create a scatter plot comparing petal length and sepal length by species with color coding.
b.	Use boxplots or violin plots to compare the distribution of each numeric feature across species.
c.	Build a heatmap to visualize correlations between all four numeric features.
d.	Create a bar chart showing the average sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each species.
e.	Use a pie chart or donut chart to show the proportion of each Iris species in the dataset.

Step-by-Step Guide for Data Visualization in Tableau using Iris.csv
To perform these operations in Tableau, follow these instructions:

1. Load the Dataset into Tableau
Open Tableau Desktop.

Select File > Open and load the Iris.csv dataset into Tableau.

a. Scatter Plot: Petal Length vs Sepal Length by Species (Color Coded)
Drag Sepal Length to the Columns shelf.

Drag Petal Length to the Rows shelf.

Drag Species to the Color shelf under the Marks card to differentiate the species by color.

You should now see a scatter plot comparing Petal Length and Sepal Length with color-coded points for each species.

Optional: You can adjust the color scheme using the Color legend for better visibility.

b. Boxplots or Violin Plots: Compare Distribution of Numeric Features Across Species
Drag Species to the Columns shelf.

Drag any numeric field (e.g., Sepal Length, Petal Length) to the Rows shelf.

In the Marks card, change the chart type to Box Plot or Violin Plot (depending on your preference). You may need to select the type from the drop-down menu in the Marks card.

Repeat this process for other numeric fields to compare their distributions across species.

Optional: Add a trend line or reference line to show central tendencies.

c. Heatmap: Visualize Correlations Between Numeric Features
Drag Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width into the Columns shelf.

Drag the same features into the Rows shelf.

Change the Marks Type to Square.

Click on Color on the Marks card and drag a Measure of Central Tendency (e.g., Correlation or Sum) into it to adjust color by the correlation strength.

Adjust the Color Scale to indicate correlation strength visually (e.g., from red for strong negative to blue for strong positive).

d. Bar Chart: Average Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width for Each Species
Drag Species to the Columns shelf.

Drag Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width to the Rows shelf.

Right-click on each of these fields and select Measure > Average to show the average of each feature.

Convert the chart type to Bar (if it is not automatically selected).

Optional: Add labels to the bars for clearer comparison.

e. Pie Chart or Donut Chart: Proportion of Each Iris Species
Drag Species to the Columns shelf.

Drag Number of Records (or COUNT(Species)) to the Rows shelf.

Change the chart type to Pie Chart by selecting it from the Marks dropdown.

To create a Donut Chart, create a dual-axis chart:

Drag Number of Records again to the Rows shelf.

Change one of the axes to Circle (donut) by adjusting the chart type in the Marks card.

Right-click on the second axis and select Synchronize Axis.

Format the chart to remove the center circle.

f. Interactive Dashboard: Filters and Visualizations to Update Species Prediction
Create multiple sheets with the visualizations you want (scatter plot, boxplots, heatmap, etc.).

Create a new Dashboard by clicking on the Dashboard tab and selecting New Dashboard.

Drag and drop the individual sheets onto the dashboard area.

To add filters, drag the Species field (or other features) to the Filters shelf in your dashboard.

Enable interactive filters so that when you select a value, the visualizations update automatically.

Add Range filters for numeric features like Sepal Length and Petal Width to dynamically adjust the range of values.

Customize the layout to create an easy-to-read, interactive interface with proper titles, legends, and filters.
