35. Perform the data visualization operations using tableau.
[Student Performance Analysis- Dataset: StudentsPerformance.csv]
a. Visualize score distributions in Math, Reading, and Writing using histograms.
b. Compare performance by gender, parental education, and lunch type.
c. Create a KPI dashboard showing average scores and pass/fail rates by gender.
d. Identify if students who took the test preparation course performed better.

📥 Step 1: Import the Dataset
Open Tableau.

Click on “Connect → Text File”.

Choose StudentsPerformance.csv.

Tableau will load the dataset with columns like:

gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, writing score.

a. Visualize Score Distributions Using Histograms
📊 Sheet 1: Histogram for Math Scores
Drag math score to Columns.

Click the drop-down on math score → select Convert to Dimension.

Drag Number of Records to Rows.

On the toolbar, click Show Me → choose Histogram.

Rename: Math Score Distribution

Repeat for:

📊 Sheet 2: reading score

📊 Sheet 3: writing score

b. Compare Performance by Gender, Parental Education, and Lunch Type
📊 Sheet 4: Average Score by Gender
Drag gender to Columns.

Drag math score, reading score, and writing score to Rows.

Right-click → Dual Axis and Synchronize Axis (optional).

Convert to Bar Chart via Show Me.

📊 Sheet 5: Avg Score by Parental Education
Drag parental level of education to Columns.

Drag math score, reading score, and writing score to Rows.

Convert to Bar chart, or use a boxplot (via Show Me).

📊 Sheet 6: Lunch Type Comparison
Drag lunch to Columns.

Drag average math score, reading score, and writing score to Rows.

c. KPI Dashboard for Average Scores and Pass/Fail Rates by Gender
🎯 Create Calculated Fields:
Go to Analysis → Create Calculated Field.

Name: Pass Math
Formula: IF [math score] >= 40 THEN "Pass" ELSE "Fail" END

Repeat for Reading & Writing (use 40 as passing mark or your own logic).

Create KPI metrics:

Average Math Score: Drag math score → Rows, change mark to Text.

Drag gender to Columns to split by gender.

Repeat for reading & writing.

For pass/fail rate:

Drag Pass Math to Rows and gender to Columns.

Drag Number of Records to Text.

Convert to Percentage: Right-click → Quick Table Calculation → Percent of Total.

d. Compare Students Who Took Test Prep Course
📊 Sheet 7: Test Prep Course Comparison
Drag test preparation course to Columns.

Drag average math score, reading score, and writing score to Rows.

Convert to Bar chart.

Use Color or Label to enhance clarity.

🧩 Final Step: Create an Interactive Dashboard
Click New Dashboard.

Drag in all relevant sheets:

Score Distributions

Gender/Lunch comparisons

KPI Metrics

Test Prep Comparison

Add Filters:

Right-click on gender, lunch, etc. → Show Filter
